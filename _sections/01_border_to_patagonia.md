# Border to Patagonia (Passages 1-3)

## Overview
- Distance: 52.1 miles
- Estimated Days: 2-3
- Daily Mileage: 17-26 miles
- Elevation Range: 4,200 ft to 9,466 ft
- Best Season: March-May, September-November

## Trail Description
The journey begins at the Mexican border in the Coronado National Memorial, where the Arizona Trail officially starts its 800-mile traverse of the state. The trail immediately challenges hikers with a steep ascent through oak woodlands to Miller Peak, the highest point in the Huachuca Mountains. This climb offers spectacular views into Mexico and across southern Arizona but demands careful water management.

From Miller Peak, the trail descends through pine forests and traverses the crest of the Huachuca Mountains, passing several reliable springs. The middle section drops into the historic San Rafael Valley, a vast grassland that provides a gentler hiking experience with sweeping views of the surrounding mountains.

The final stretch winds through the rolling Canelo Hills, characterized by oak woodlands and seasonal creeks. This section offers more moderate terrain but requires attention to water sources, especially in dry seasons. The trail concludes in the welcoming town of Patagonia, where hikers can rest and resupply.

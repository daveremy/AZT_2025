## Trail Description
{{ section.description }}

The trail begins at the Mexican border monument, immediately climbing through oak woodlands into the Huachuca Mountains. A challenging ascent leads to Miller Peak (9,466'), offering expansive views into Mexico and across southern Arizona. The route then traverses the crest of the range before descending to Lutz Canyon.

From here, the trail enters the rolling Canelo Hills, passing through grasslands and oak savannas. The terrain becomes more gentle but remains exposed, with Parker Canyon Lake providing a welcome water source. The final stretch crosses Red Rock Canyon before descending through historic ranch lands to the trail town of Patagonia.

| 5.8 | Bathtub Spring | Developed spring with pipe, good flow in spring. Located just off trail under tree cover. Clear water, still recommend filtering. | 90% |

### Water Strategy
- **Real Experience Tips**:
  - Many first-time hikers overcarry "emergency water" - trust the water report
  - Spring hikers typically find 4L capacity sufficient
  - Filter more frequently rather than carrying full day's water
  - Consider caching water at Montezuma Pass for Day 1
  - Morning start with 3L usually sufficient except peak summer

  - Parker Canyon Lake is a good place to camel up and do laundry

### Daily Water Planning

- Bear Saddle Spring unreliable - check recent reports
- Parker Canyon Lake reliable refill

Day 3: Parker Canyon to Red Rock

- Long carry to Red Rock Tank
- Tank conditions vary - have backup plan

## Trail Description
Departing the North Rim, the trail traverses the high-elevation Kaibab Plateau through a mix of ponderosa pine, spruce, and aspen forests. The initial segment offers occasional views back into the Grand Canyon while climbing through pristine wilderness areas.

The middle section crosses vast mountain meadows that provide excellent wildlife viewing opportunities, particularly for deer, elk, and wild turkey. This stretch includes some of the most remote and peaceful hiking on the entire AZT, with the trail passing through ancient bristlecone pine stands and wildflower-filled meadows.

The final portion maintains its high elevation character while gradually descending toward the Utah border. The trail passes through more open terrain with views extending north into Utah. The journey concludes at the historic Arizona Trail Northern Terminus monument at the Utah state line, marking the end of the 800-mile traverse of Arizona.

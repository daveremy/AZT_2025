## Trail Description
The journey begins at the South Rim using the South Kaibab Trail, which offers the most direct route into the canyon. The initial descent is steep and fully exposed, dropping through distinct geological layers with spectacular views at Ooh-Aah Point, Cedar Ridge, and Skeleton Point. The trail continues its dramatic descent to the Colorado River at Black Bridge.

After crossing the river, the trail reaches the historic Phantom Ranch, an oasis in the inner canyon. Following Bright Angel Creek northward, the trail enters "The Box," a narrow gorge where the creek has carved through ancient Vishnu Schist. This section offers welcome shade and the sound of running water.

The final segment climbs steadily through the Supai Formation and Coconino Sandstone via the North Kaibab Trail. The ascent is challenging but rewards hikers with increasingly expansive views. The trail emerges on the North Rim through a forest of ponderosa pine and aspen, marking a dramatic transition from the inner canyon environment.

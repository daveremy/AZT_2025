## Trail Description
Leaving Pine, the trail follows the base of the Mogollon Rim, crossing the scenic East Verde River multiple times. The initial segment features a mix of pine forest and high desert vegetation, with the dramatic backdrop of the rim constantly present to the north.

This stretch offers consistently cooler temperatures and more reliable water sources than southern sections. The trail skirts Blue Ridge Reservoir, providing opportunities for scenic views and reliable water.

The final portion traverses rolling terrain through a mix of pine and juniper forests, gradually ascending to the Mormon Lake area. This segment features some of the largest alligator juniper trees in Arizona and offers expansive views across the Colorado Plateau.

## Using the FarOut App for Planning

The FarOut app is an essential tool for thru-hikers, providing detailed maps, water sources, and user-generated comments. Here's how you can use it effectively during your shakedown hikes:

- **Planning**: Use the app to plan your route by viewing detailed maps and elevation profiles. This helps in understanding the terrain and planning your daily mileage.
- **Water Sources**: Check the app for the latest information on water sources along your route. User comments often provide updates on water availability and quality.
- **Navigation**: Utilize the GPS functionality to track your location on the trail in real-time, ensuring you stay on course.
- **Community Insights**: Read comments from other hikers for tips on campsites, trail conditions, and any potential hazards.

Familiarizing yourself with the FarOut app during shakedown hikes will prepare you for its use during the main thru-hike, ensuring you have reliable information at your fingertips.

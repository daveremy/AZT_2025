# Water Treatment Strategies by Source Type

## General Guidelines
- Always inspect water sources before collecting
- Consider pre-filtering heavily silted water
- Carry multiple treatment methods as backup
- Note treatment time increases in cold temperatures
- Consider carrying a scoop for shallow sources

## Source Types and Strategies

### Town Water (Reliable)
Examples: Oracle, Superior, Patagonia
- Treatment usually optional
- Consider treating if:
  - Town has water quality advisory
  - Recent pipe work/disruptions
  - Personal preference
- Methods:
  - Direct drink
  - UV purification
  - Chemical treatment if concerned

### Developed Springs (Usually Reliable)
Examples: Bathtub Spring, Gate Spring
- Treatment recommended
- Methods:
  - Filter (primary)
  - UV treatment
  - Chemical backup
- Notes:
  - Check pipe/collection area for contamination
  - Look for animal activity nearby
  - Consider flow rate when collecting

### Natural Springs/Creeks (Seasonal)
Examples: Bear Spring, Lemmon Creek
- Full treatment required
- Methods:
  - Filter + chemical treatment
  - Filter + UV treatment
- Notes:
  - Pre-filter if cloudy
  - Check upstream for cattle/wildlife
  - Collect from flowing sections
  - Avoid stagnant pools

### Stock Tanks (Seasonal/Unreliable)
Examples: Freeman Road Tank, Red Rock Tank
- Maximum treatment recommended
- Methods:
  - Filter + chemical treatment (primary)
  - Consider multiple filtering passes
- Notes:
  - Collect from cleanest part of tank
  - Use floating debris as wind indicator
  - Avoid collecting near edges
  - Watch for algae blooms

### Natural Pools/Tinajas (Seasonal)
Examples: Hutch's Pool
- Full treatment required
- Methods:
  - Filter + chemical treatment
  - UV treatment as backup
- Notes:
  - Check for animal activity
  - Avoid disturbing sediment
  - Collect from surface when possible

## Treatment Methods

### Filtering
- Recommended: 0.1 micron or better
- Options:
  - Sawyer Squeeze
  - Katadyn BeFree
  - Platypus QuickDraw
- Maintenance:
  - Backflush regularly
  - Keep filter from freezing
  - Pack spare gaskets

### Chemical Treatment
- Options:
  - Aquamira drops (primary recommendation)
  - Iodine tablets (backup)
  - Chlorine dioxide tablets
- Notes:
  - Temperature affects treatment time
  - Pre-filter cloudy water
  - Check expiration dates

### UV Treatment
- Options:
  - SteriPen
  - UV caps
- Notes:
  - Requires clear water
  - Battery dependent
  - Not effective in silty water

## Special Situations

### High Sediment Water
1. Pre-filter through bandana/coffee filter
2. Let settle in container
3. Decant clear water
4. Filter through primary system
5. Consider chemical treatment

### Green/Algae Water
1. Avoid if possible
2. Use multiple treatment methods
3. Filter through cloth first
4. Use chemical treatment
5. Consider taste neutralizer

### Low Flow Sources
1. Create small dam if appropriate
2. Use scoop or cup to gather
3. Let settle before filtering
4. Be patient - don't damage source

## Emergency Backup Options
1. Carry Aquamira tablets as backup
2. Know how to make charcoal filter
3. Carry extra filter gaskets
4. Know boiling procedure
5. Carry backup collection container

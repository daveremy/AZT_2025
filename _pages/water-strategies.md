# My AZT Water Plan

## Basic Rules
Remember to:
- Check sources before collecting
- Pre-filter if looks silty
- Always have backup treatment
- Cold = longer treatment time
- Bring scoop for shallow spots

## Water Sources + How to Handle

### Town Water (Easy)
Places like Oracle, Superior, Patagonia
- Usually safe to drink
- Fill up max capacity
- Good place to clean filters
- Check hours/access

### Reliable Sources (Springs/Creeks)
- Primary filter = Platypus
- Backup = Aquamira drops
- Pre-filter if needed
- Note flow rate in comments

### Questionable Sources (Tanks/Ponds)
- Pre-filter ALWAYS
- Use both treatments
- Let settle if super murky
- Avoid surface scum
- Check for critters

### Cattle Tanks
- Last resort
- Look for inlet pipe
- Avoid algae spots
- Double treatment
- Note reliability in comments

## My Setup

### Capacity (6L max)
- 2L Platypus bladder
- 2x 1L Smart bottles
- 2L backup capacity

### Treatment
Primary: Platypus Filter
- Good for 1000L
- Backflush regularly
- Watch for slow flow
- Keep from freezing

Backup: Aquamira
- 2hr shelf life when mixed
- 30 min treatment
- Works in any temp
- Good for sketchy sources

## Section Strategies

### Desert (Border to Superior)
- Carry max capacity
- Cache water if needed
- Early morning water runs
- Note seasonal sources

### Mountains (Superior to Pine)
- More reliable sources
- Still check ahead
- Watch for snow melt
- Reduce capacity (4L typical)

### North (Pine to Utah)
- More reliable overall
- Check seasonal flows
- Snow = good source
- Keep filter from freezing

## Daily Routine
1. Check next source distance
2. Calculate needs + safety margin
3. Treat before running low
4. Note source conditions in comments
5. Update water report

## Source Finding
Apps/Maps:
- Guthook
- FarOut
- USGS topos
- Satellite view

Local Beta:
- Call ahead
- Check trail reports
- Ask other hikers
- Update water report

## Remember
- Don't get lazy on treatment
- Better to carry extra
- Update water reports
- Check sources ahead
- Keep filter working
- Trust your gut

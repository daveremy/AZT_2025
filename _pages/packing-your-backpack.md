# Personal Packing Notes for AZT Thru-Hike

Key reminders for packing my backpack:
- Keep heavy stuff close to my back, between shoulder blades
- Quick-access items within easy reach
- Balance the weight for stability
- Minimize stuff sacks - they just create dead space

## My Worn Clothing Setup
What I'm wearing while hiking:
- OR Echo Hoody as my main layer
- Ketl shorts
- Airism boxers
- Injinji trail socks
- Adidas Terrex (sized up for swelling)
- Baseball cap for sun

## How I'm Organizing Everything

Keep it simple:
- Food all together in the Ursack
- Electronics & small stuff in a waterproof ziplock
- Sleep clothes (HH tech shirt, NB shorts, Injinji liners) in their own ziplock
- Bathroom kit: trowel, wipes, TP, sanitizer
- Basic toiletries in small ziplock
- Everything else: loose pack = better space use

## Bottom of Pack (Sleep Stuff)
Night setup goes here:
- 20F Zpacks quilt
- XLite pad
- Xmid tent (when dry)
- Sleep clothes
- Rain pants
- Camp shoes
- Anything else not needed until camp

## Middle Section (Heavy Items)
Core weight here:
- Ursack with food
- Firemaple cooking setup
- 2L Platypus (pre-filtered)
- Puffy when not wearing it
- Spare base layer

## Top Section (Quick Grab)
Stuff I need during the day:
- Rain gear
- First aid
- Day snacks
- Water filter
- Bike gloves
- Buff
- Bathroom kit
- Basic toiletries

## Outside Pocket
Quick access + wet stuff:
- Wet tent when needed
- Things I grab often
- Wet gear that needs to dry
- Poles during breaks

## Pocket Setup

Hip Belt:
- Large hip belt pockets for snacks, phone, sunscreen
- Easy one-handed operation
- Balanced weight distribution between pockets

Shoulder Straps:
- Both straps have large top-opening pockets
- Perfect for phone, small water bottles
- Insta360 mount on right strap
- InReach on left strap

Side Pockets:
- Two large water bottle pockets
- QuickPocket in left side for quick access to larger items (hat, gloves, snacks)
- Poles when not using
- Wet items that need to dry

Front Mesh Pocket:

## Important Reminders

Weather Protection:
- Check forecast daily
- Pack garbage bag if rain likely
- Electronics in waterproof ziplocks
- Insta360 - remember the cap
- Wet tent goes in front mesh
- Keep rain gear handy
- KEEP SLEEP STUFF DRY

Efficiency Notes:
- Minimal stuff sacks
- Pack tent body separate from stakes
- Strategic ziplocks:
  * Electronics/power
  * Sleep clothes
  * Bathroom stuff
  * Basic toiletries
- Quick-grab items accessible
- Pre-dried wipes = lighter

Trail Specific:
Desert Sections:
- More water = more stability
- Sun protection easy to grab
- Quick water treatment access
- Watch pack ventilation

Mountain Sections:
- Rain gear + warm layers handy
- Fast camp setup for storms
- Less water needed
- Adjust straps for terrain

Spring Setup (March-May):

- Gloves handy up high

Common Mistakes (Don't Do These):
1. Overpack

4. Bury frequently used items
5. Slack on weather protection

Pre-Hike Checklist:

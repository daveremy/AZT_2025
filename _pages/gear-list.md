## Still Need
- First aid kit
- Nav tools
- Sun stuff
- Toiletries
- Repair kit
- Docs

## Strategy Notes

### Desert (Border to Superior)
- Max water: 6L (2L bladder + 2x 1L bottles + 2L backup if needed)
- Double water treatment (filter + drops)
- Ursack = good enough here
- Need groundsheet for sandy spots
- Xmid = good ventilation

### Mountains (Superior to Pine)
- Same gear + warmer stuff (TBD)
- Still using Ursack + proper hangs
- Multiple stake options = good
- Xmid handles wind well
- Can drop to 4L water usually

### North (Pine to Utah)
- 20F quilt = good for cold nights
- Xmid = storm ready
- Stakes good for forest soil
- 4L water typically enough
- InReach + phone crucial for forest nav

## Notes to Self
- Current base = 13.12 lbs (210.03 oz)
- Water capacity = flexible based on reports
- Double water treatment = peace of mind
- All gear tested on shakedowns

*Living document - update as I test more gear and do shakedowns*

# Arizona Trail Resources

## Seasonal Planning
### Spring (March-April)
- Most popular hiking season
- Benefits:
  - Wildflowers in bloom
  - Fresh flowing water (after winter precipitation)
  - Hiking with sun at your back
  - More daylight hours vs autumn
- Typically NOBO (Mexico to Utah)
- Start timing considerations:
  - Too early: freezing nights, deep snow on Kaibab Plateau
  - Too late: extreme desert heat

### Autumn (October-November)
- More stable weather conditions
- Benefits:
  - Good water availability after monsoon season
  - Less crowded than spring
  - More solitude
  - Stable weather conditions
- Typically SOBO (Utah to Mexico)
- Popular with Americans aiming to finish before Thanksgiving

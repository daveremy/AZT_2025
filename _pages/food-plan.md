## Food Strategy Notes

### Daily Food Template
Need to hit these targets:
- Breakfast: 400-600 cal
- Morning Snacks: 400-500 cal
- Lunch: 500-600 cal
- Afternoon Snacks: 400-500 cal
- Dinner: 700-800 cal
- Evening Snacks: 200-300 cal

Target: 2600-3300 cal/day depending on section

### Food Rules
1. Keep it simple:
   - No-cook breakfast + lunch
   - Hot dinner = morale boost
   - Snacks = easy access

2. Resupply Strategy:
   - 4-5 days max between resupply
   - Mail drops for tricky spots
   - Buy fresh when possible

3. Important Stuff:
   - Pack out first day's lunch
   - Double-check calories
   - Test all new foods before trail
   - Watch salt/electrolytes in desert

### Section-Specific Notes

Desert Sections:
- More salty snacks
- Extra electrolytes
- Foods that handle heat
- No chocolate

Mountain Sections:
- More calorie dense
- Warm breakfast option
- Hot drinks for cold mornings
- Chocolate okay here

### Resupply Points

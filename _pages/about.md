# About This Journey

I'm preparing for a thru-hike of the Arizona Trail starting March 15, 2025. This site serves as my planning hub and documentation for the journey.

## Mentorship & Acknowledgments

I'm incredibly fortunate to be mentored by Jeff Garmire ([FreeOutside](https://freeoutside.com)), an accomplished ultra-distance hiker who has held FKTs (Fastest Known Times) on multiple trails. Jeff's expertise and guidance are instrumental in my preparation for the AZT and future hiking endeavors.

His insights on food planning, logistics, and trail strategy are helping shape my approach to this thru-hike. Thank you, Jeff, for sharing your knowledge and experience!

## Purpose

This site contains my detailed planning for:
- Trail sections and navigation
- Food and resupply strategy
- Water management
- Gear selection and testing
- Logistics and transportation

Follow along as I prepare for this adventure!
